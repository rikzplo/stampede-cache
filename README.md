## 📋 What is stampede-cache?

stampede-cache is a software tool that helps make apps and websites run faster by storing and reusing data smartly. It manages data in more than one place ("multi-tier caching"), handles many requests at once without slowing down ("async caching with request coalescing"), and prevents the system from getting overwhelmed when many users ask for the same thing at the same time ("thundering herd prevention"). It can also find similar items by meaning, not just exact matches ("semantic similarity matching").

This tool is built with popular technology like Python and Redis, which keep things running quickly and smoothly.

## ⚙️ How stampede-cache Works

This application stores frequently requested data in a way that saves time and resources. Here’s what it does for you:

- **Multi-tier caching:** Saves data in several layers so retrieving it is quick.
- **Async caching:** Handles many requests at the same time without delays.
- **Request coalescing:** Combines multiple similar requests to avoid repeating work.
- **Thundering herd prevention:** Stops the system from slowing when many try to get the same info simultaneously.
- **Semantic similarity matching:** Finds answers that mean the same thing even if written differently.

These features make your app or site respond faster and use less internet and computer power.

## 🔧 Using stampede-cache

You don’t need to configure anything to get benefits for typical use cases, but here are some common options you might see:

- **Cache expiry settings:** Control how long data stays stored before refreshing.
- **Cache layers:** Choose which kind of storage to use first, such as memory cache or Redis.
- **Verbose logs:** Turn on messages describing what the cache is doing, helpful for troubleshooting.
- **Enable semantic matching:** Activate or deactivate meaning-based retrieval.

The app includes simple menus or preferences to adjust these. If you plan to use it alongside other software or scripts, documentation inside the app or the GitHub page explains setup for developers.
